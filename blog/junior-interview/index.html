</span>

I&#39;m a former competitive figure skater, graduate of the Nashville Software School, and software engineer at DramaFever, a subsidiary of Warner Bros.
</p>

<p>Outside of work, I&#39;m a weekly panelist on the JavaScript Jabber podcast, and I regularly participate in a variety others. In my spare time I love speaking at conferences, playing with new technology, running, working out, and trying new flavors of Kombucha!</p>
<h2 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-you-work-with-junior-developers-" id="how-do-you-work-with-junior-developers-"></a><span class="text">How do you <em>work with junior developers</em>?</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#how-do-you-work-with-junior-developers-">#</a></h2>
<p>My work with junior developers comes mostly in the form of mentorship. Indirectly, I also believe I&#39;m able to reach juniors on a deep level by being a panelist on JavaScript Jabber and, through my conference talks and blog posts.</p>
<p>As far as mentorship, I&#39;ve worked one on one with developers in a more formal sense where we set up weekly chats, and I also devote a substantial amount of time each week making myself available for more one of conversations on the phone, through Twitter DM or email. I&#39;ve found the latter to be the most common.</p>
<p>In regards to JavaScript Jabber, I usually spend a bit of time prepping for each episode, and I always try to write down the questions that I initially have since I know others getting started will probably be in the same boat!</p>
<p>For my conference talks, I spend a lot of time brainstorming ideas and organizing my content in a way that will make it approachable to newbies, but also valuable to someone who&#39;s been programming for a decade. That is the most challenging aspect of speaking for me, but as someone newer, it&#39;s essential to me.</p>
<h2 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-does-working-with-junior-developers-differ-from-working-with-senior-developers-" id="how-does-working-with-junior-developers-differ-from-working-with-senior-developers-"></a><span class="text">How does <em>working with junior developers</em> differ from working with senior developers?</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#how-does-working-with-junior-developers-differ-from-working-with-senior-developers-">#</a></h2>
<p>Working with junior developers is only slightly different from working with a mid-level or senior developer in my opinion. With junior developers, it&#39;s imperative to have a level of awareness in the situation.</p>
<p>In other words, a lot of juniors feel intimidated, so it&#39;s important to check in often and ask direct questions like, &quot;does that make sense&quot;? It&#39;s far too common for newer developers to not speak up due to the intimidation factor. I also advise when pairing to resist the urge to take over and let the junior drive!</p>
<h2 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-to-work-with-junior-developers-" id="why-to-work-with-junior-developers-"></a><span class="text">Why to <em>work with junior developers</em>?</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#why-to-work-with-junior-developers-">#</a></h2>
<p>I hear senior developers express to me how valuable and thought to provoke it&#39;s been for them when a junior presents them with carefully thought out questions. Statistically, it&#39;s also precious for seniors to work with juniors. Mentors are six times more likely to be promoted, and 20% more likely to get a raise.</p>
<p>Besides that, working with a junior can do wonders for burnout. Most juniors, especially those from boot camps are extremely hungry. The energy and passion they have for the field are contagious!</p>

<p>There are so many things I could name, but personally, I&#39;m most excited about PWA&#39;s and AI! As far as PWA&#39;s, I&#39;ve always wanted to build for mobile, and even in web development, I think AI is going to have a huge impact.</p>
<p>There are already things like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aEfpARsP8Fg?rel=0#">The Grid</a> that use machine learning to build websites! I recently bought <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning">Grokking Deep Learning</a> and am excited to dive into it.</p>
<h2 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-advice-would-you-give-to-programmers-getting-into-web-development-" id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-programmers-getting-into-web-development-"></a><span class="text">What advice would you give to programmers getting into web development?</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#what-advice-would-you-give-to-programmers-getting-into-web-development-">#</a></h2>
<p>My advice is to get comfortable being uncomfortable. I have a <a href="https://youtu.be/B22o_yeDE_s">talk</a> on this... that&#39;s how strongly I feel about it being the key to success. For me, some of the hardest obstacles in my journey have been with my self-doubt. If you&#39;re aware of that though, you can shift your focus.</p>
<p>We are all human, and we have a finite amount of mental energy. So, it&#39;s important that you spend it wisely! If you can learn to become comfortable with the feeling of not knowing, you&#39;re able to focus solely on the challenge at hand, and you&#39;ll inevitably be able to tackle it that much faster!</p>
<p>I also encourage juniors to try and find a mentor or programming buddy. If you can find a mentor, it&#39;s probably the fastest way to progress. Developers who received mentoring were promoted five times more often than those who didn’t.</p>
<p>If nothing else, you can try to work on some small open source projects and get mentorship in the form of code reviews there. <a href="https://yourfirstpr.github.io/">Your First PR</a> is an excellent resource for finding newbie friendly projects.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a huge fan of Kyle Simpson, so I&#39;d be excited to see an interview with him next! I love his approach to learning vanilla JavaScript over focusing on a framework when you&#39;re getting started, and his content is comprehensive while also being completely approachable!</p>
<h2 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#any-last-remarks-" id="any-last-remarks-"></a><span class="text">Any last remarks?</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#any-last-remarks-">#</a></h2>
<p>My latest deep dive topic has been CSS and browser internals. I spent two years as a full-stack JavaScript developer and made the switch to front end last summer. Working for an affiliate of Warner Bros means that design implementation is critical! It wasn&#39;t like the previous applications I&#39;d worked on where the designs could be fudged a little. Applications for Warner Bros properties need to be pixel perfect!</p>
<p>I quickly realized I struggled with debugging CSS in the same systematic way I debugged my JavaScript. So, whether you&#39;re a newer developer or you&#39;ve been programming a while you may be interested in a <a href="http://www.aimeemarieknight.com/It&#39;s-Not-Dark-Magic-Pulling-Back-the-Curtains-From-Your-Stylesheets/">blog post</a> I just finished all about this!</p>

<p>Thanks for the interview Aimee! I&#39;ve found working with people from different backgrounds helps to give you perspective. Magic happens when you combine the views and find something new.</p>
