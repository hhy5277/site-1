You have to know who you are against after all! It&#39;s not an understatement to say could that it&#39;s about to get swarmed with books. In this post I&#39;ll go through the ones I could find and provide you some intel on them. Perhaps you would like to get a couple of books to your collection!</p>
<h2 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#free-books" id="free-books"></a><span class="text">Free Books</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#free-books">#</a></h2>
<p>Even though there are <a href="https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react">a lot of freely available React resources</a> there aren&#39;t too many free books yet.</p>
<h3 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#survivejs-webpack-and-react" id="survivejs-webpack-and-react"></a><span class="text">SurviveJS - Webpack and React</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#survivejs-webpack-and-react">#</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://survivejs.com/">SurviveJS - Webpack and React</a> is the most comprehensive freely available book I&#39;m aware of. It will show you how to set up a <a href="https://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a> based development environment and then develop a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a> based on it. More theoretical topics, such as linting, styling and library authoring are discussed as well. At the time of writing it has over 250 pages and more content is planned based on demand.</p>
<p>The book is open to external contributions and in fact a lot of people have contributed feedback and fixes. From author&#39;s point of view this has been just awesome!</p>
<p>If you like the book and want to support the effort, <a href="https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack_react">buying a digital copy</a> would most likely make the author&#39;s day. Suggested price without VAT is $19.99. Pay based on value you perceive as Leanpub books allow.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/SurviveJS-Webpack-React-apprentice-master/dp/152391050X">a paper version available through Amazon</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://christianalfoni.github.io/react-webpack-cookbook/">React Webpack Cookbook</a> is a little guide I developed with <a href="http://www.christianalfoni.com/">Christian Alfoni</a>. The eventual plan is to polish the content and host the improved version here with a similar support model.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hackingwithreact.com/">Hacking with React</a> by Paul Hudson delves straight into React. At the time of writing it has 123 pages and it uses a no-nonsense approach. In some ways it&#39;s the anti-thesis to SurviveJS, but there&#39;s room for different kind of offerings. Even though the book is free to read online, the author offers it through <a href="https://leanpub.com/hackingwithreact/">Leanpub</a> as well. The minimum price without VAT is $10.</p>

<h2 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#commercial-books" id="commercial-books"></a><span class="text">Commercial Books</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#commercial-books">#</a></h2>
<p>The commercial side of React books is about to go wild. <strong>Developing a React Edge</strong> was likely the first book on the market. Since then a few others have followed. The challenge for authors is that as React moves forward quite fast. Books will require constant maintenance effort to stay up to date.</p>
<h3 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#developing-a-react-edge-the-javascript-library-for-user-interfaces" id="developing-a-react-edge-the-javascript-library-for-user-interfaces"></a><span class="text">Developing a React Edge: The JavaScript Library for User Interfaces</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#developing-a-react-edge-the-javascript-library-for-user-interfaces">#</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781939902122.do">Developing a React Edge</a> by Frankie Bagnardi, Jonathan Beebe, Richard Feldman, Tom Hallett, Simon HÃ¸jberg and Karl Mikkelsen was published by Bleeding Edge Press at November 2014. At 234 pages it covers a wide range of React related issues starting from the very basics and including aspects such performance tuning, server side rendering and testing.</p>
<p>As I haven&#39;t bought the book it is hard for me to evaluate how up to date it is. The book has both digital and paperback versions available. At Amazon the price is around $30 for both VAT included. At O&#39;Reilly digital edition costs $22.99.</p>
<h3 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#react-d3-js" id="react-d3-js"></a><span class="text">React+d3.js</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#react-d3-js">#</a></h3>

At <a href="https://leanpub.com/reactd3js">Leanpub</a> it&#39;s minimum price is $9 while suggested on is at $19 VAT excluded. There are expanded packages available that provide more material such as screencast and example code. In the book you will build a small data visualization project based on the technologies.</p>
<p>If you want a quick read that&#39;s straight to the point, this could be it. It&#39;s nowhere broad as <strong>Developing a React Edge</strong> for instance but if you just want to visualize data, this might work.</p>

<p>A lot of the React books have significant overlap. Their length ranges from very short (63 pages) up to quite long (301 pages). There&#39;s also wide variance in pricing as a result. The cheapest goes for $5 while the most expensive costs $49. There are both self-published options and books backed by a publisher. It is hard to comment on the quality of the books as I haven&#39;t read these.</p>
<p>The situation is very interesting. It&#39;s going to be difficult for a book to stand out content-wise. The biggest differentiating factor I can see is actually openness of the book. My book is a notable exception to the rule. It&#39;s going to be interesting to see if it makes any difference compared to the competition and publisher backed options.</p>
<p>Let me know if I missed some awesome book at the comments and I&#39;ll add it to the listing.</p>
