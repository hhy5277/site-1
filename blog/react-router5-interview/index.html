  I have a degree in engineering, although my education was for most parts non specialised, I ended up studying a bit more mechanical and electronics engineering. I have always been programming in my spare time and hacking stuff, and inevitably, my early professional career slowly drifted towards software engineering. I explored a few areas and languages: embedded software on micro-processors, desktop applications and web applications.
</p>

<p>I did a fair amount of full-stack web development, and a few years ago I decided to take front-end development very seriously, being amazed by what a difference Node.js and social coding had started to make. I am a French national, I am currently a software engineer at Fanduel and live in Glasgow, Scotland.</p>
<h2 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-would-you-describe-react-router5-to-someone-who-has-never-heard-of-it-" id="how-would-you-describe-react-router5-to-someone-who-has-never-heard-of-it-"></a><span class="text">How would you describe <em>react-router5</em> to someone who has never heard of it?</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#how-would-you-describe-react-router5-to-someone-who-has-never-heard-of-it-">#</a></h2>
<p><em>react-router5</em> (and router5) is a different way of thinking about routing in front-end applications, and a way which I think suits a lot more trees of components. Instead of focusing on what component to render for what route, or providing a handler function per route, it sees routing as going from A to B, not loading B.</p>
<p>There is clear separation of concerns: router5 will take care of checking routing can happen and provide route updates. react-router5 provides ways to update your virtual tree, but won&#39;t do it for you. So you can have control over routing. I am not the only one testing and implementing new ideas around routing though.</p>
<h2 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-did-you-develop-react-router5-" id="why-did-you-develop-react-router5-"></a><span class="text">Why did you develop <em>react-router5</em>?</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#why-did-you-develop-react-router5-">#</a></h2>
<p>I started using React a little more than a year ago, while still developing heavily with Angular. Working alongside a back-end team using Scala, I had slowly been introduced to functional programming, immutability, reactive programming, etc... I played with React, used it on a playground project at home, and one of the really first thing I searched for was a router. I think it is a habit most of us have, having being used to rely on frameworks. And no surprise on the outcome, I ended up with react-router.</p>
<p>Slowly, my practice of React evolved. I started to reject state, played with Flux without being fully convinced, looked a lot at reactive programming but I didn&#39;t know what to do about routing. It felt like it was standing on my way, I wasn&#39;t building my application virtual tree, a router was doing it for me. So I started to play with routing, implementing custom solutions.</p>
<p>The first ones reflected my thoughts at the time: it was all very confusing. I slowly realized I wanted routing to be treated the same way application state changes are. Therefore, I didn&#39;t need a router for React. And not only did I need a library or framework agnostic router, I needed a router spitting out route updates as data updates, and not a router defining routes as a map of paths and route handlers.</p>
<p>I looked around and couldn&#39;t find what I was after. At the time, an article mentioning <a href="https://github.com/pillarjs/routington">pillarjs/routington</a> on DailyJS was published, I really liked the idea of a trie of routes. It mirrors your tree of components which helps building a mental model about your application and routing in general.</p>
<p>But I wanted to use named routes with parameters and it became router5 starting point: developing a library allowing to build a tree of named routes (route-node, supported by path-parser) before developing a router. It was also a conscious effort to explode routing in specialised parts, and remove the tight coupling between routes and components. I took some inspiration from various sources, including new generation frameworks like Aurelia and Angular2 for functionalities.</p>
<p>A few months back, shortly after ReactEurope 2015, I remember watching Christopher Chedeau saying about routers during his keynote: <em>&quot;We have seen only one player emerge which is react-router... Is there any innovation going on? ... Actually, innovation already happened a few years ago and it happened in the Ember community...&quot;.</em> That fuelled my motivation and made me accelerate on router5. Once router5 was released in July, I started to focus on integration with React but lacked time and maturity. And it is only now with 1.0.0 that a solid React integration is provided with react-router5.</p>
<h2 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-kind-of-challenges-have-you-experienced-while-developing-it-" id="what-kind-of-challenges-have-you-experienced-while-developing-it-"></a><span class="text">What kind of challenges have you experienced while developing it?</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#what-kind-of-challenges-have-you-experienced-while-developing-it-">#</a></h2>
<p>The first barrier was to believe routing is complicated, there was an intimidation factor. Once I started to focus on specific areas and to split concerns, those initial concerns went away. One other challenge was to detrain from libraries and frameworks I was used to, and trying not to be too much influenced by existing routing solutions.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think I had major technical challenges, I was for example able to re-use previous experiences around lexical analysis and tokenisers to build a library for parsing and matching paths. I otherwise needed to let my thoughts and knowledge mature over time. For react-router5, I had to gain experience on higher-order components to be able to propose them rather than mixins.</p>
<h2 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-next-" id="what-next-"></a><span class="text">What next?</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#what-next-">#</a></h2>
<p>Version 1.0.0 of router5 is an important milestone because it totally removes side-effects from the router core. URL and browser history are now fully treated as side-effects, like DOM updates are side-effects of state updates and virtual tree re-renders. It also introduces plugins and improves on the use of middleware functions. The next step would be to start to see stuff emerge from the community.</p>
<p>The second important aspect is data loading. I don&#39;t currently have examples demonstrating how it can be achieved. Partially because there are so many ways data loading can be handled depending on how you handle state, and partially because I am careful not to introduce tight coupling where I wouldn&#39;t want to see some. But I will explore GraphQL and Falcor and see if there is a need to introduce integration helpers.</p>
<p>I would also like to improve the overall quality of the documentation I provide in order to attract more people.</p>
<h2 class="header"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-the-future-look-like-for-react-and-front-end-in-general-can-you-see-any-particular-trends-" id="what-does-the-future-look-like-for-react-and-front-end-in-general-can-you-see-any-particular-trends-"></a><span class="text">What does the future look like for React and front-end in general? Can you see any particular trends?</span><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#what-does-the-future-look-like-for-react-and-front-end-in-general-can-you-see-any-particular-trends-">#</a></h2>
<p>The biggest trend right now is functional programming. At the component level, it means context-free and state-free components with higher-order components linking them to state and context. The second trend is reactive programming, outside components.</p>
<p>I mentioned above having routes in a tree to help with building mental pictures, having an application state as a tree is also very beneficial in that sense, and I believe in global application states. I am currently using redux on a greenfield project and released <a href="https://github.com/router5/redux-router5">redux-router5</a>.</p>
<p>I also like Baobab a lot and follow what Christian Alfoni is doing with Cerebral, and what Andre Staltz is doing with CycleJs. I recently wrote an article about <a href="http://blog.reactandbethankful.com/posts/2015/09/15/understanding-the-functional-revolution/">understanding the functional revolution in front-end applications</a>.</p>
<p>For React, the future will be towards stateless, context-less, this-less functional components. It only started with 0.14.</p>
